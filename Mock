Q2 BD 13
A coupon-paying bonds have several cash flows before maturity and thus a positive convexity, while zero-coupon bonds has only one payment at maturity and thus 0 convexity.
B when interest rate deviation increases, yield curve tends to move unparallelly and thus have more twist changes. Duration can be of less use than Convexity when dealing with unparallel movement and twists in the yield curve to implement immunization or other strategies. This makes convexity more valuable.
C Rolling yield = 3.5/100 + (103.7-102.3)/102.3 = 4.87%
Total return = rolling yield + (0.35%+0.2%)*4.5 + 1/2*(0.35%+0.2%)^2*25 + 1% = 4.87% + 2.51% - 1% = 6.38%

B. immunization strategy can be used to manage single liability, which is the one that Hannon has and wants to manage.
C. X. The duration of X at 4.98 matches with the single five-year liability, which has a duration close to 5. It also has lower convexity.
D. No. All else equal, lower convexity is generally better to signify lower sensitivity to unparallel change and twists in yield curve, which helps to manage fixed income.

A. Green needs to keep his confortable lifestyle after he retires five years later.

B. tax efficiency ratios
Large cap 1-6/8=25%
International developed 1-8/12 = 33%
Taxable bond 1-2.5/4=37.5%

Taxable bond is the least tax efficient

C. i equity monetization also typically use short sales or derivative contracts, which are prohibited in the jurisdiction.
ii charitable remainder trust will make the investor have to lose control over the original assets.
iii exchange fund is the most appropriate.

D. Market value after 8 years: 2,000,000*(1+8%)^8 = 3,701,860
Tax on sale = (3,701,860 - 100,000)*25% = 900,465
Final value = 3,701,860 - 900,465 = 2,801,395
