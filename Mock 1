Q3 ALT
A When market is volatile, there is hardness to form a profitable view on the market trend, whether it be bull or bear. With non-trending and ambiguous market, a market neutral strategy would be beneficial to capture alpha instead of market trend.
B 200,000 * 0.89 / 1.05 = 169,524
C i. dedicated short and short-biased have high volatility and thus high risk. Using high leverage would increase the exposure to extreme left tail risk. Thus, modest to low leverage should be implemented.
ii. distressed securities strategy also has high exposure to left tail risk and extreme downside risk. High leverage would not be approriate because it only exacerbates the exposure.
iii. volatility trading bears high volatility already.

A Small cap index. It has less number of constituents so replication can be more easily implemented.
Small cap has smaller size, and full replication can result in less market impact.
B Large cap, bottom quartile. It has the lowerst daily trading volume thus less liquid. And it is more likely to migrate, bearing higher trading costs.
Small cap, top quartile. It is more possible for this quartile to migrate.
C buffering strategy. buffering can give candidate constituents a buffer or a room to be selected, thus reducing the migration.

A Delay cost. Time decay of alpha decreases the return when placing orders are delayed after decisions are made.
Opportunity cost. The stock universe is thinly traded but Winters makes large order. Some orders may not be fullfilled in this situation and not all desired position can be acheived resulting in opportunity cost.
Trade cost from unfavorable market move. Since Winters can trade in momentum, the market move is unfavorable thus resulting in high bid-ask spread and cost.

B Stock lending. She can lend her stock to borrowers that need short selling. Risk is counterparty risk. The borrower could default.

A 1 is more appropriate. Execution risk can be reduced by trading evenly throughout a longer horizon. While in 2, when market is trending favorable, managers should act more aggressively to capture the return; otherwise it'll decay over time.
B 8000*(1773.25-1750.50) = 182000
C no delay cost
execution cost = 45000 * (22.13-22.12) + 10000 * (22.27-22.12) + 25000* (22.35-22.12) + 5000 * (22.43-22.12) + 5000 * (22.48-22.12) + (45000+10000+25000+5000*2)*0.05=15550

A coupon-paying bonds have several cash flows before maturity and thus a positive convexity, while zero-coupon bonds has only one payment at maturity and thus 0 convexity.
B when interest rate deviation increases, yield curve tends to move unparallelly and thus have more twist changes. Duration can be of less use than Convexity when dealing with unparallel movement and twists in the yield curve to implement immunization or other strategies. This makes convexity more valuable.
C Rolling yield = 3.5/100 + (103.7-102.3)/102.3 = 4.87%
Total return = rolling yield + (0.35%+0.2%)*4.5 + 1/2*(0.35%+0.2%)^2*25 + 1% = 4.87% + 2.51% - 1% = 6.38%

1 no, annual spending = 4% * $1 m = $0.04 m < ???
2 The endowment has a long term goal to sustain the university. This long term investment term gives them higher risk tolerance.
 liquidity needs are low as the endowment have diverse and sufficient way to finance its spending, even including high rating bond issuance at AA+ rating.
3 Endowment model has higher allocation to real estate and other alternative invesment to capture long term return while the current portfolio only has public equities and fixed income securities.
Endowment model also use active management to capture alpha while Noeway model passively manages its portfolio.
Endowment model has higher variance to generate higher return while Norway model has low tracking error.

The spending policy is sufficient.  
The investable base after payment of the start up’s initial capital is: 
Investable base = $24,000,000 – $1,000,000 = $23,000,000. 
AMLAIC’s total funding requirement of $1,800,000 is reduced by external funds, with 
expected value at the middle of the confidence interval: 
Expected (external funds) = ($1,400,000 + $400,000) / 2 = $900,000. 
Relative to the investable base, the outlay requirement is: 
Required outlay = ($1,800,000 – $900,000) / $23,000,000 = 3.91%.

 favoring increased risk tolerance: 
• ESUE has significant capacity for fundraising in relation to spending policy. 
• ESUE supports a small percentage of the university’s operating budget.

B. immunization strategy can be used to manage single liability, which is the one that Hannon has and wants to manage.
C. X. The duration of X at 4.98 matches with the single five-year liability, which has a duration close to 5. It also has lower convexity.
D. No. All else equal, lower convexity is generally better to signify lower sensitivity to unparallel change and twists in yield curve, which helps to manage fixed income.

A. Green needs to keep his confortable lifestyle after he retires five years later.
Green wants to buy a vacation place to live in three months.

B. The vacation house has a relatively low priority compared to the children's education as to when to support the needs.
As the vacation house has low importance, Green can postpone the timing of the purchase if necessary rather than an immediate investment within 3 months.
Green wants to supports two daughters' tuition fees starting next year as the time is relatively soon and important to him. This education needs should be priotized.

C. Green's goal and the charity's goal may differ and have different investment term, meaning the allocation strategy should be treated differently. But Green wants to invest in the same as some of the Charity's portfolio.

D. Term is short for Green. As Green is 68, the investment term is too short for him to align with the alternative's long term goal.
Liquidity needs are higher for Green, but those cannot be easily provided by the alternative investments.
Risk tolerance is relatively low for Green while alternatives investments have relatively high volatility.

C. 1 is correct. The startegy is hedge CAD exposure in holding assets. They should use a 6-month forward points bid offer to 'sell' the CAD assets, which is 1.3342 + 155 * 0.01% = 1.3497
2 is correct. The trend for CAD/USD is decreasing meaning CAD is appreciating. Hedging CAD exposure (short position) would bring loss for rolling the contracts, which means the roll yield would be negative

Roll yied

One month ago, the value of SIGF assets in CAD are 500 million. 
Today, the value of SIGF assets in CAD is 520 million. 
The foreign investment in terms of Canadian dollars increased by CAD 20 million; hence 
Schwinn must increase the size of the hedge by selling another CAD 20 million in 
addition to the CAD 500 million initially sold a month ago.  
To sell another CAD 20 million forward today, Schwinn will have to buy USD, in the base 
currency CAD/USD quote. Therefore, the offer side of the market must be used.

B. tax efficiency ratios
Large cap 1-6/8=25%
International developed 1-8/12 = 33%
Taxable bond 1-2.5/4=37.5%

Taxable bond is the least tax efficient

C. i equity monetization also typically use short sales or derivative contracts, which are prohibited in the jurisdiction.
ii charitable remainder trust will make the investor have to lose control over the original assets.
iii exchange fund is the most appropriate.

D. Market value after 8 years: 2,000,000*(1+8%)^8 = 3,701,860
Tax on sale = (3,701,860 - 100,000)*25% = 900,465
