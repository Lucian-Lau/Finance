Volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is used to achieve fair and reasonable prices 
over the trading period throughout the day when there is market noise. Market noise 
represents intraday volatility with price distortions throughout the day.  
Time-weighted average price (TWAP) is used to achieve fair and reasonable prices 
over the trading period throughout the day when there is no market noise. Time
weighted average price (TWAP) is used when managers wish to eliminate the volatility 
and exclude potential trade price outliers.
