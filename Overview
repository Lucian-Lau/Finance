Over the next five months, the S&P 500 experiences a realized volatility of 20%;
At the end of the five-month period, fair strike of a new seven-month variance swap on S&P 500 will be 18%;    The annual interest rate is 1.50%
Variance notional = 1,000,000/(2*15) = 33,333

1. Measure
Implement
Shortfall =
(1) execution cost + 
(2) opportunity cost + (3) fee

$ cost



(1) execution cost = delay (slippage) cost + trading cost (price at placing)
= (buy - arrival + arrival - decision price) * buy unit
Delay cost = (arrival - decision) * buy unit
Arrival, Trading cost = (buy - arrival) * buy unit

(2) opportunity cost = (closing price - decision price)  * NO buy unit
(3) fee = unit fee * buy unit

Decide, place by PM
Arrive, receive, release by trader / agency
Execute, buy
Opportunity, close
$/share cost

BP cost
Smaller or more negative = better
$/share = cost / share
BP = $*10000 / (unit*share)
Market adjusted cost  = arrival cost BP - ß index cost BP

Arrival cost BP = buy / arrival - 1
Index cost BP = buy / arrival - 1
Market impact
Market adj cost = impact, pressure by the order
Arrival cost = impact, rising market itself

(Rp - Rf) = å + ß(R.market-Rf) + e
*Appraisal = å + StD(e)
Information = (R.PF-R.BM)/∂(PF-BM)
Sortino = (R.PF-R.BM)/∂semi = penalize downside


Universe
Suitability, style, philosophy (active vs p)
Efficient market → bad & good less diff
I, explicit cost of commision to bad, + avoid
II, opportunity, omission of good, less painful
Quantitative
- Attribution & appraisal: skill
- Capture ratio
- Drawdown
Style Analysis = attribution & appraisal
1. Return, RBSA, top down, imprecise
Straightforward & less data
NO window dressing

BAD for illiquid stale, ex. venture capital

2. Holding Based, HBSA, bottom up, precise
Risk factors & exposure
Window dressing ← snapshot of PF

BAD for illiquid stale
Quality, due diligence
Inv = process & people, PF, philosophy
!! key person risk, staff turnover,
Operational = infrastructure (firm, vehicle, term, monitoring) & track record accuracy
Vehicle & Term
 - Liquid
!! Closed end fund & ETF = + liquid
SMA = direct owner, custom = + liquid
Open end fund = daily liquidity = - liquid
Pooled = indirect, decide by fund = - liquid
- Fee





!!
Symmetric = NO Max / Min fee, fully exposed to up and downside = bankruptcy risk +
AUM based = - fee in rising market, “sticky”
Asymmetric = Max / Min cost → CALL
Ex. Sharing fee = reward upside
Performance based = + cost in rising market but also when underperforming, align client interest, smooth upside ∂
Closet indexing, claim active but passive 
= charge incentive fee for active MGMT
Soft lock = + redemption fee
Base fee = charged no matter
Standard fee = fee at breakeven
Sharing fee $ = sharing % * Active r
Active r = r - Base fee
Risk ∂ MGMT
= Stop loss
Frequency agree with signal


!! Hard stop → frequent trade
Liquid asset → less trading cost


Ethics
Code = CFA & candidate; Passed but NO enrolled <> candidate
Firm is encouraged but NO member
AMC = firm
GIPS = firm/independent entity, NO composite
Professional
Law = legal, cultural, religious laws
Independence = disclose gift (no approval → violate NO this but Employer); fee NO linked
Misrepresentation = use “WILL” opinion; typo & no adj; plagiarism; no verify/disclose 3rd
Misconduct = affect job; dishonest
Market
Material nonpublic information (MNI) = reliable; impact (key event, famous analyst)
Manipulate = multi accounts to + volume; NO for Exchange, trading strategy, tax purpose
Clients
Loyal = Beneficiary (Plan & Trust), Mandate/IPS (MF); Soft dollar benefit client; 
Fair trade = priority; NO equally
Suit = can hedge if within style; 3rd is suit
Performance = composites, each including similar style; disclose simulate data
Confidential = FORMER + now + prospective; NO PII
Employer
Employer = Full & Part time at work, NO affect job OR abuse assets
Compensation = from client / subject company = employer WRITTEN approval & disclose
Supervisor = investigate & limit if violation, just warning NO enough
Inv
Reasonable = NO change ranking if pressured = irrelevant to COI
Retention: Regulation >> CFA (7 yrs); Hard and/or E-copy
Disclose: Related & POTENTIAL: B2B & indie relation (job offer even turned down); holding; director
$$$ = (1) ST bonus package < 1 year; (2) Referral: %
Trading & holding = trade after client; ANY INV personnel & $; 
Terminate relation > Invest COI company if disclosed  >  restrict list (for broader universe)
Conflict of interest (COI)
NO sensitive company’s strategy meeting
Priority: client > employer > self & relative (within clients NO violate this but fair trade)
Trading or IPO
Disclose: Extended absence of leadership
Compensate
Client = disclose NO Amount BUT relation & holding = meet all
Employer (1) disclose amount $ & written approval = meet all
                (2) disclose $ & NO approval = VIOLATE Employer; meet Independence, COI 
Compliance, Designated & qualified; employee or officer; independent of INV process or CIO
Backup; client, employee, related; Hard and/or E-copy; Repository (monitor, trade, analyze if big)
Frequency
MM =Return
QQ = Performance & Inv State, 30 days after Q ends
YY = Suitability review, sooner of PRE big change (beyond IPS)
GIPS 
047 & 048 !!
R = end/beg - 1;  Total R = (1+R1) * (1+R2) - 1
Cash flow, denominator, weighted using ratio
Return, numerator, NO discounted → only actual; simulated only as appendix
Composite
Fee discretionary must YES,    # of PF vs composite
1 PF    →  >=1 composites, include any position of style
1 composite → NO Max / Min PF
Free discretionary may ?
Free non-discretionary must NO
Fees either GROSS or NET (before or after) tax & fees; Average OR Expected fees; items of fees when asked; Trading fee exclude custody
Reporting >= 5 years since claim, building up to >= 10 years; since inception if <= since;  53 !!
Record Portability
Job change = Primary & independent decision maker; track record; jobs break < 2 months
Merger, A + B = A, A comply, B NO comply
 → 1 year grace period
