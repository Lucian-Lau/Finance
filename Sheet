Trainor: Agoals-based approach to asset allocation is appropriate for individual investors, but institutions need to focus either on the asset or liability side of the balance sheet, depending on the nature of their business.
Kely: Atypical objective of some institutions si to maximize their Sharpe ratio for an acceptable level of volatility, and they rely on the law of large numbers to assist them in
modeling their liabilities. Other institutions behave much like individuals by segmenting general account assets into sub-portfolios associated with specific lines of business with
their individual return objectives.
The most appropriate statement in regards to approaches to asset allocation by institutions is made by:

Tommanson hesitates to decrease equities because it outperforms over the last quarter and believes recent data should be heavily weighted. This emphasis on recency is status quo bias. This could result in less relevancy of the correlation among variables and thus less accuracy of prediction.

Wuyan searches repeatedly for correlation between variables and equity returns. This is data-mining bias, potentially resulting in including less relevant variables. Model irrelevant

Tommanson suggests including data back another 20 years. This could raise risk of regime change, potentially resulting in altering the relationship between variables and return.

Based on high correlation, Wuyan concludes nominal GDP predicts return. This is misinterpretation of correlation. This only signifies the positive relationship between nominal GDP and return but not causation.

Bond yields increases and yield curve continues to [steepen]
Equity returns increases and becomes more volatile
Short term interest rate continues to [decrease]

Low cash holding is favorable in this situation for the company. Cash is generally not attractive because lower inflation means lower short term interest rates for cash holding. But cash can be attractive if there is an interest rate floor at 0 when inflation rate is negative.

High quality Bonds are favorable when in recession and thus the fund would benefit from holding high position in high quality bonds. The high exposure to high quality bonds thus is favorable.

Equities are less favourable when in recession especially for asset-intensive and commodity-producing. The fund would benefit from decreasing exposure to these equities.

[Real estate is favorable when in recession and inflation rate is low or negative. The high position in real estate is favorable to this fund.]
