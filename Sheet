Minkof states, "I think a better strategy would be for Kadakia to undertake a calendar spread strategy, which si appropriate when there si an expectation for share prices to move in a certain direction but not immediately. Such a strategy focuses on taking advantage of the time value decay of stock options; however, it si only appropriate when implied volatility si expected to increase.
nI her statement, Minkoff si least likely correct with regard to:
A. implied volatility.
B. the time value decay of options.
C. the direction and timing of a price move.

M2.3.1 The fixed-income assets include US$10 million invested ni one-year US Treasury bonds. Stuyvesant's evaluation of global bond and currency markets indicates that she can increase the yield on the portfolio by selling the Treasury bond position and buying Japanese government bonds of the same maturity. The data she uses for her assessment show that the US bonds pay 1.75% and Japanese bonds pay -0.40% annualized. She plans to fuly hedge the currency risk. The YEN/USD spot rate si 106.85, the one-year YEN/USD forward rate si 106.12, and the one-year YEN/USD cross currency swap basis is -0.63.
Does Stuyvesant's proposal to buy Japanese bonds most likely increase the yield on the portfolio? 
A. Yes, it increases the yield.
B. No, because the yen appreciation does not compensate for the lower Japanese rate
C No, because paying the basis would further erode the return on the Japanese government bonds.

M2.8.2 Neeson comments, "The durations for almost half of the bonds ni the Wharton portfolio are clustered around 4 years, and the durations of the remainder around 12 years, while the durations of the Lawson portfolio bonds are clustered between 6years and 8years. nI general, a laddered bond portfolio approach would improve liquidity management for both, although the Lawson portfolio would experience an increase in cash flow reinvestment risk and the Wharton portfolio would experience a decrease in convexity."
Is Neeson most likely correct in his assessment of the effects of a laddered bond portfolio approach on the Wharton and Lawson portfolios?
Yes
No, because the Lawson portfolio is a bullet portfolio where the duration of its assets are matched to the duration of its liabilities "
No, because the duration of the Wharton liabilities is greater than that of the Lawson liabilities owing to the younger age of its participants

Trainor: Agoals-based approach to asset allocation is appropriate for individual investors, but institutions need to focus either on the asset or liability side of the balance sheet, depending on the nature of their business.
Kely: Atypical objective of some institutions si to maximize their Sharpe ratio for an acceptable level of volatility, and they rely on the law of large numbers to assist them in
modeling their liabilities. Other institutions behave much like individuals by segmenting general account assets into sub-portfolios associated with specific lines of business with
their individual return objectives.
The most appropriate statement in regards to approaches to asset allocation by institutions is made by:
A. B. C.
Kelly, regarding their goals-based allocations.
Trainor.
Kelly, regarding the Sharpe ratio and modeling of liabilities.

Tommanson hesitates to decrease equities because it outperforms over the last quarter and believes recent data should be heavily weighted. This emphasis on recency is status quo bias. This could result in less relevancy of the correlation among variables and thus less accuracy of prediction.

Wuyan searches repeatedly for correlation between variables and equity returns. This is data-mining bias, potentially resulting in including less relevant variables. Model irrelevant

Tommanson suggests including data back another 20 years. This could raise risk of regime change, potentially resulting in altering the relationship between variables and return.

Based on high correlation, Wuyan concludes nominal GDP predicts return. This is misinterpretation of correlation. This only signifies the positive relationship between nominal GDP and return but not causation.

Low cash holding is favorable in this situation for the company. Cash is generally not attractive because lower inflation means lower short term interest rates for cash holding. But cash can be attractive if there is an interest rate floor at 0 when inflation rate is negative.

High quality Bonds are favorable when in recession and thus the fund would benefit from holding high position in high quality bonds. The high exposure to high quality bonds thus is favorable.

Equities are less favourable when in recession especially for asset-intensive and commodity-producing. The fund would benefit from decreasing exposure to these equities.

[Real estate is favorable when in recession and inflation rate is low or negative. The high position in real estate is favorable to this fund.]
